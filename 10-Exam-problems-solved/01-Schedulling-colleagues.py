# MartinBG solution:
# jobs = [int(job) for job in input().split(', ')]
# target_index = int(input())
#
# target_job = jobs[target_index]
# cycles = 0
#
# for i in range(len(jobs)):
#     current_job = jobs[i]
#     if current_job < target_job or current_job == target_job and target_index >= i:
#         cycles += current_job
#
# print(cycles)

# Another colleague's solution:
jobs = [int(job) for job in input().split(', ')]
index = int(input())
cycles = 0
current_index = -1

while current_index != index:
    current_index = jobs.index(min(jobs))  # first occurrence of the min amount of clock cycles
    current_job = min(jobs)  # take the amount of min clock cycles
    jobs[current_index] = max(jobs) + 1  # set element on current index to max + 1 to not get processed again
    cycles += current_job  # add the clock cycles
print(cycles)
